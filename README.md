Thank you for your interest in the DDSBC tool. We have decided to remove the code from our GitHub repository to better manage its distribution and ensure proper use.

Additionally, please attach your CV, including a list of publications and a cover letter. If you are a graduate student or postdoc, please CC your Principal Investigator in the email.
Furthermore, please fill out and sign the attached License Agreement Form and include it with your email. This agreement ensures that the code is used responsibly and legally, allowing us to take appropriate action if the code is distributed without our consent.
